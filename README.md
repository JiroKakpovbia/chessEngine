The CS246 Final Project - Chess + Enhancements
____________________________________________________________________
Welcome to Chess! Please choose from the following commands:

'game \<white-player\> \<black-player\>' starts a new game. The parameters \<white-player\> and \<black-player\> can be either human or computer[1-4].
  - eg. 'game human computer2' starts a game with the White player being Human and the Black player being a Computer.

'resign' concedes the game to your opponent. This is the only way, outside of winning or drawing the game, to end a game.

'move \<start\> \<end\>' moves one of the pieces on the board. The parameters \<start\> and \<end\> specify the starting and ending coordinates of the piece to be moved.
  - eg. 'move e2 e4' moves the piece on e2 to e4.

Castling would be specified by the two-square move for the king.
  - eg. 'move e1 g1' (right castle) or 'move e1 c1' (left castle) for White.

Pawn promotion would additionally specify the piece type to which the pawn is promoted.
  - eg. 'move e7 e8 Q' moves a Pawn from e7 to e8 (the other end of the board), and subsequently makes it a Queen.

In the case of a computer player, the computer will make its move on its own.

'setup' enters setup mode, within which you can set up your own initial board configurations. This can only be done when a game is not currently running. Within setup mode, the following commands are used:

'+ \<piece\> \<square\>' places the piece onto the board. Specifically, it places \<piece\> onto \<square\>. If a piece is already on that square, it is replaced.
  - eg. '+ K e1' places the piece K (i.e., White king in this case) on the square e1.

'- \<square\>' removes the piece from the parameter \<square\>. If there is no piece at that square, nothing happens.
  - eg. '- e1' removes the piece from e1.

'= \<colour\>' makes it colourâ€™s turn to go next.
  - eg. '= black' makes it the Black player's turn to go next."

'clear' removes every piece on the board.

'done' exits setup mode.

**Remember:** White pieces = UPPERCASE, Black pieces = lowercase
